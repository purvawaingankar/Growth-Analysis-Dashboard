# Growth-Analysis-Dashboard
Problem Statement: 
The company, despite an increase in their total sale each year, the profit rate is not been growing 
consistently. We must analyze the issue and recommend changes to maintain the company’s growth. 

Analysis:  
The key metrics such as total sales and profit, current year sales and profit, total number of products 
sold, order count and the CAGR are used to understand whether the company is making the profit or 
loss in the ongoing year and to do comparison. 
For growth analysis we need to understand various factors such as, 
1. Sales Trends 
• From bar chart, we can clearly understand that there is consistent growth in the sales of 
the company every year, but the profit remains almost same every year.  
2. Category 
• Tree map helps us to understand that which products contributes least to the sales 
growth and it belongs to which category. 
3. Months 
• Top 5 highest performing months help us to understand that people order mostly during 
festival seasons. 
4. Returns 
• The return percentage can determine various factor including product quality, defective 
products and product quantity issues. 
• The highest return product according to region helps to determine whether which 
product has been returning the most and is that for all region or for any particular region. 
5. Profit 
• The profit is the main factor of the company and analyzing it will help to determine the 
growth of sales. 
Filtering out the data according to region, years and category helps us to clearly understand the reason 
and view the required data.

Conclusion: 
The company’s growth can be maintained by focusing on improving operational efficiency and 
enhancing customer satisfaction. Implementing the recommended strategies will not only sustain the 
company’s growth but will also increase its profit margins leading to company better future.
